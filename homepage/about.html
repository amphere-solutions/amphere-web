                        <p>To create an environment where charging will be a handy amenity regardless of space and time, with 
                        people not having to worry about their low battery levels.</p>

                        <h2 class="title">WHY?</h2>
                        <p>We at Amphere understand that with the indispensability of mobile phones the need to maintain their 
                        battery levels has become equally essential. No matter where one is, operating one’s phone on the 
                        low battery is stressful. And with the heaping piles of functions that we’ve assigned to our phones, 
                        it is quite obvious that they require a fair share of power. However, despite how cautiously 
                        we charge our devices, things can always end in the definition of a modern disaster – a dead phone! 
                        So, what do you do when you need a backup in the middle of the city? Do you treasure hunt for a 
                        charging point or you log into the barely alive mode of your mobile and hope it doesn’t die on you?</p>

                <div class="need">
                    <h2 class="title">WHAT?</h2>

                    asking friends or strangers for favours. Be it an important call at home or some other urgent work 
                    on your phone, you can handle it all with our assistance. Just visit the nearest Amphere partnered

                    <h2 class="title">HOW?</h2>

                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> Visit the nearest Amphere partnered café/restaurant.</p>
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b> Ask for Amphere.</p>
                    <p><b>Step 3:</b> Tada!!! You have it with you. Charge your phone and reconnect with your world again with a prolonged battery life.</p>

                    <!-- <p>In today’s time, people are connected to their phones at every level, so much so that mobiles have
                       become indispensable. From work to pleasure, from calling family to networking with the world,
                       people use their phones for every other thing. No matter where one is, the sign of a low battery is
                       always stressful. But these low battery foes are going to be a thing of past soon.
                       People will find the solution at their doorstep. With no provision of a public charging facility in the
                       city, Amphere partners with cafes which are willing to offer a unique experience to their customers,
                       bringing greater satisfaction. This will very likely create a greater goodwill of the restaurant as it will
                       be catering to the needs of the tech savvy youth.</p>

                    <p>Amphere will not just provide a service but a better experience at your restaurant. A happy customer
                       likely to come back again and spread a good word in the market.
                       Surveys have shown that people are likely to spend around 30% more time in the restaurant and order
                       more if they have a charging facility to avail. This means one in every four consumers looks for
                       restaurants that can promise readily available charging facility.</p>

                    <p>A provision like this builds a likeability and eventually a sense of trust within the consumer for the
                       café. They keep returning to the place as they expect similar enjoyable and comfortable experiences.
                       With our service, we will target the broader needs of your consumer base and ensure that a pleasant
                       experience is built not simply in terms of food but also the technological facilities.</p> -->
